**[AI in Automation]**  
<br/>
This Repository contains all the learnings of my AI in Automation R&D. Along with this, it will also be containing any projects that I believe would make sense doing.

> AI Terminologies:
- LLM: Large Language Model -> Tools/Service/System trained with huge sets of data.
- Agent: An Agent is a system or program that takes instructions from an LLM and performs real-world tasks using external tools. It acts as a helper that `"does"` things the LLM cannot do on it's own.
- MCP: Model Context Protocol

> Task Flow:
- User --> [Prompt] --> `LLM` --> `Agent` --> `MCP` --> [Action Execution]

> What is MCP?
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework that connects LLM(s) to real-world-tools (like browsers, databases, APIs).
- It allows LLM(s) to send commands to these tools and get results.
- Think of MCP as a bridge between the LLM and your computer/tools.
